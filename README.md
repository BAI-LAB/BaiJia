# BaiJia: A Large-Scale Role-Playing Agent Corpus of Chinese Historical Characters

BaiJia is a role-playing agent corpus focused on Chinese historical characters. It aims to enhance the role-playing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by providing high-quality, low-resource data.

## Project Structure

- **Demo_Baijia**: A publicly available portion of the dataset for experimentation and evaluation.
- **Eval_Question**: A set of evaluation questions to assess the performance of LLMs.
- **Eval_Resume**: A collection of character resumes used for role-playing evaluations.

## Evaluation Dimensions

We provide six comprehensive dimensions to evaluate the role-playing performance of LLMs:

1. **Character Consistency (CC)**  
   - Alignment with character background and historical dynasty context.

2. **Dialogue Ability (DA)**  
   - Coherence and logical flow of dialogue.  
   - Interactivity in conversations.

3. **Character Appeal (CA)**  
   - Charm and attractiveness of the character.  
   - Emotional impact during interactions.

4. **Emotional Expression & Intellectual Depth (EI)**  
   - Authentic emotional expressions.  
   - Intellectual and philosophical insights.

5. **Creativity & Role Depth Expansion (CR)**  
   - Character personality and innovative thinking.  
   - Complexity and further development of the character.

6. **Cultural & Historical Appropriateness (CHA)**  
   - Language style matching character identity and historical era.  
   - Alignment with the historical and cultural context of the era.

## Usage Instructions

1. Use **Demo_Baijia** as the dataset for SFT.
2. Combine **Eval_Question** and **Eval_Resume** to evaluate the role-playing ability of your language models.
3. Evaluate models based on the six key dimensions mentioned above.
